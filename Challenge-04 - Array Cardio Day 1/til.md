Things I learned (key points).
  - .sort(compareFunction)
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
    - Specifies a function that defines the sort order. If omitted, the array is sorted according to each character's Unicode code point value, according to the string conversion of each element.
  - DOM nodeList to array using Array.from() or [...xxx]
  - using ternary operator with multiple expression (by using parentthesis "()" )
