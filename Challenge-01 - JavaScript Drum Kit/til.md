Things I learned (key points).
  - <audio> tag
    - rewinding by setting audio.currentTime = 0;
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio
  - es6 fat arrows function
    - it does not bind its own this, arguments, super, or new.target
    - best suited for non-method functions, and they cannot be used as constructors
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions
    - Destructuring assignment ( discovery :D )
      - makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.
